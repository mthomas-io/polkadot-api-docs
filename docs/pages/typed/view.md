# View Functions

View functions are particular [Runtime APIs](/typed/apis) linked to pallets. Therefore, their API is exactly the same as any runtime API. They are found under `typedApi.view`. See [APIS](/typed/apis) documentation for usage notes.

:::warning
Remember that View Functions are only available if the chain exposes version 16 (or ahead) of the metadata.
